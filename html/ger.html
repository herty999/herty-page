		<h2 id="SdK_221">SdKfz 221 Leichter Panzerspähwagen</h2>
		<img src="../img/300px-IWM-E-3776-SdKfz-222-19410624.jpg" alt="Leichter Panzerspähwagen">
		<p>Designed to meet operational requirements including reliability, run on a variety of grades of fuel, 
		simple construction and good off-road performance the first such vehicle was the Sd Kfz 221 but this 
		proved too small and too lightly armed, so in 1936-37 a heavier version was planned, using one of two 
		standard chassis for four-wheel armoured cars, one with a front-mounted engine, the other rear-mounted 
		version, was used in the Sd Kfz 222, which became the standard light armoured car in German army service 
		until the defeat of Nazi Germany.

		The vehicles were developed by Eisenwerk Weserhütte of Bad Oeynhausen by using the chassis of the type Horch 108 
		standard heavy off-road car with an angled armoured body and turret.
	
		Chassis were built by Horch (Auto Union) in Zwickau and assembled by F. Schichau of Elbing and Maschinenfabrik 
		Niedersachsen in Hanover-Linden.
		
		The rear-mounted petrol engine was originally a 3.5 Litre Horch V8 with 75 PS (55 kW; 74 hp) (Ausf. A chassis); 
		from 1942, this was replaced by a 3.8 Litre with 90 PS (66 kW; 89 hp) (Ausf. B chassis), giving it a road speed of 
		80 km/h (50 mph) and a cross-country speed of 40 km/h (25 mph). It had a maximum range of 300 km (186 mi).
		
		Used by the reconnaissance battalions (Aufklärungs-Abteilung) of the Panzer divisions, the type performed 
		well enough in countries with good road networks, like those in Western Europe. However, on the Eastern Front 
		and North Africa, this class of vehicle was hampered by its relatively poor off-road performance.

		<h2 id="SdK_231">SdKfz 231 Schwere Panzerspähwagen</h2>
		<img src="../img/300px-Wehrtechnische_Studiensammlung.jpg" alt="Schwerer Panzerspähwagen">
		<p>The heavy Panzerspähwagen was a large but very fast and highly versatile addition to the German Army. 
		The original 6 Rad (6 wheel) versions were based on a 6x4 truck with an armoured body, but by 1937 they
		were being replaced by the 8 Rad versions. During the replacement, the Sd.Kfz. (Sonderkraftfahrzeug, "special vehicle") 
		numbers were carried directly over; differentiation is made by the addition of 6-Rad or 8-Rad in the vehicle's name.

		These vehicles were used throughout the war in various guises and first saw combat in the campaign against Poland and in the 
		Battle of France. Later, they saw use in both the USSR and North Africa campaigns. Extreme climatic conditions in both these
		areas proved too severe for the vehicle. In the USSR, adverse ground conditions immobilized 150 Sd.Kfz 232s during the first
		wet season of the campaign.[citation needed] The speed of the eight-wheeled cars made them the best scouting vehicles that Rommel
		had for long range reconnaissance across the wide desert territory.</p>

		<h2 id="MB">Mercedes-Benz L3000</h2>
		<img src="../img/Bundesarchiv_Bild.jpg" alt="Mercedes-Benz L3000">
		<p>The Mercedes-Benz L3000 was a 4x2 3-ton rear axle drive truck used
		by Germany in World War II, powered by a Daimler-Benz OM 65/4 74 hp 
		4-cylinder diesel engine. It was used alongside the Opel Blitz, and 
		proved even more reliable in rough terrain; and was used in all fronts 
		and extensively by the Afrika Korps. It was manufactured in three versions, the L3000, the L3000A, and the L3000S,
		from 1938 to 1943; by that time 
		more than 27,700 of all versions had been built. This made it the
		most produced Mercedes-Benz truck of World War II.

		<h2 id="VK">Volkswagen Kübelwagen</h2>
		<img src="../img/280px-VW_Kuebelwagen_1.jpg" alt="VW type 82 Kübelwagen">
		<p>Although Adolf Hitler discussed with Ferdinand Porsche the possibility of military application 
		of the Volkswagen as early as April 1934, it was not until January 1938 that high-ranking Third Reich 
		army officials formally approached Porsche about designing an inexpensive, light-weight military transport
		vehicle, that could be operated reliably both on- and off-road, in even the most extreme conditions. This 
		implied that the Beetle could provide the basis for such a vehicle.

		Porsche began work on the project immediately, having a prototype of the vehicle ready within the month, but realized 
		during development that it would not be enough to reinforce the Beetle's chassis to handle the stresses that military
		use would place on it. In order to guarantee adequate off-road performance of a two-wheel-drive vehicle with a 1,000
		cc FMCV 1 engine, it would have to be lightweight. In fact, the army had stipulated a laden weight of 950 kg (2,090 lb),
		including four battle-dressed troops, which meant that the vehicle itself should not weigh more than 550 kg (1,210 lb).
		Porsche therefore sub-contracted Trutz, an experienced military coachbuilder, to help out with the body design.

		Developmental testing by the military began after a presentation of the prototypes designated as Type 62 in November
		1938. Despite lacking four wheel drive, a mainstay of the American military Jeeps, the vehicle proved very competent
		at maneuvering its way over rough terrain, even in a direct comparison with a contemporary standard German army 4×4, 
		and the project was given the green light for further development. The vehicle's light weight and ZF self-locking 
		differential compensated for the lack of 4×4 capabilities.</p>

		<h2 id="VS">Volkswagen Schwimmwagen</h2>
		<img src="../img/280px-VW_Schwimmwagen_1.jpg" alt="Volkswagen Type 166 Schwimmwagen">
		<p>Volkswagen Schwimmwagens used the engine and mechanicals of the VW Type 86 four-wheel 
		drive prototype of the Kübelwagen and the Type 87 four-wheel drive 'Kübel/Beetle' Command Car, 
		which in turn were based on the platform of the civilian Volkswagen Beetle. Erwin Komenda, Ferdinand 
		Porsche's first car body designer, was forced to develop an all-new unitized bodytub structure since 
		the flat floorpan chassis of the existing VW vehicles was unsuited to smooth movement through water. 
		Komenda patented his ideas for the swimming car at the German Patent office.

		The earliest Type 128 prototype was based on the full-length Kübelwagen chassis with a 240 cm (7.9 ft) 
		wheelbase. Pre-production units of the 128, fitted with custom welded bodytubs, demonstrated that this 
		construction was too weak for tough off-roading, had insufficient torsional rigidity, and easily suffered 
		hull-ruptures at the front cross-member, as well as in the wheel-wells. This was unacceptable for an amphibious
		vehicle. The large-scale production models (Type 166) were therefore made smaller, and had a wheel-base of only 
		200 cm (6.6 ft).

		Schwimmwagens were produced by the Volkswagen factory at Fallersleben / Wolfsburg and Porsche's facilities in 
		Stuttgart; with the bodies (or rather hulls) produced by Ambi Budd in Berlin. 15,584 Type 166 Schwimmwagen cars 
		were produced from 1941 through 1944; 14,276 at Fallersleben and 1,308 by Porsche. Given these numbers, the VW 166
		is the most mass-produced amphibious car in history.[citation needed] Only 189  are known by the Schwimmwagen 
		Registry to remain today, and only 13 have survived without restoration work.</p>
